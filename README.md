# Assignment 2 - HIT137 Group Project

This repository contains the solutions for the HIT137 Group Assignment 2. The assignment involves solutions of three programming problems. All the Questions are solved using Python.

## Questions are:
1. Question 1: Encrypt and decrypt a raw text file.
2. Question 2: Analyze temperature data. Calculate the average temperature, Find the station which have the largest range of temperature and have the warmest & coolest station.
3. Question 3: Use Python's turtle graphics to generate a recursive tree pattern.

## How to Run the Programs
### Question 1: Encrypt/Decrypt Text
1. In the root directory place the raw_text.txt file.
2. Run the Question-01.py script.
3. Encrypted text will be saved in encrypted_text.txt.
4. Decrypted text will be show in output.
5. On the console, you can see the Decryption verification.

### Question 2: Calculate average temperature and find largest, warmest and coolest station
1. Build pandas in your Visual studio.
2. Put the right location of the temperature data in the python code.
3. Run the question-02.py script.
4. The average of temperature will save as - average_temp.txt.
5. The largest range temperature will save as - largest_temp_range_station.txt.
6. The warmest and coolest station will save as - warmest_and_coolest_station.txt.

### Question 3: Recursive Tree Pattern
1. Run the Question-03.py script.
2. You can see a skyblue background and a sun. Minimize the output.
3. Put the values as instructed in the terminal part.
2. A window will open, showing the tree pattern with leaf.
3. Close the window to exit.
